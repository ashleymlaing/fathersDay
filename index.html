    <h2>To The Best Father</h2>
    <h1>Noel GC Laing Sr</h1>
    <div class="testimonial">
      <p>You have so many offspring, its getting harder to count. However, no matter what you do, you can't seem to kick us out. You are an amazing father, and we all love you so. I couldn't be more happy to call you my dad.</p>

      <h3>Daddy, you are</h3>
      <p>As smart as Ironman</p>
      <p>As strong as Hulk</p>
      <p>As brave as Captain America</p>
      <h3>You are my favorite Super Hero</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="testimonial">
      <h3>A Father is:</h3>
      <pre>
There in every memory
See his love and care
Strength and hands to count on
Freely he does share
Provider, toil so faithfully
To make our dreams come true
Give strong and tender discipline
Though it is hard to do
A Father is God's chosen one
To lead the family
And point it to His will for life
Of love and harmony
      </pre>
    </div>
    <div class="testimonial">
      <h3>Dad</h3>
      <pre>
He never looks for praises
He's never one to boast
He just goes on quietly working
For those he loves the most
His dreams are seldom spoken
His wants are very few
And most of the time his worries
Will go unspoken too
He's there...A firm foundation
Through all our storms of life
A sturdy hand to hold to
In times of stress and strife
A true friend we can turn to
When times are good and bad
One of our greatest blessings,
The man that we call Dad
      </pre>
